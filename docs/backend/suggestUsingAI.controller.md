- `optionPrice` (array of numbers): The prices of the options.
- `pricesFrom` (array of strings, optional): Indicates whether the prices were obtained from GPT or an external source like Polygon.

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "strategyName": "Bull Call Spread",
      "buySell": ["Buy", "Sell"],
      "positionType": ["Call", "Call"],
      "maxProfit": 1500,

      "optionPrice": [5.50],
      "pricesFrom": ["Polygon"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Internal Workflow:
1. **Extract Request Parameters**: Extract the relevant fields from the request body.
2. **Initialize OpenAI Client**: Initialize the OpenAI client with the provided API key.
3. **Generate AI Response**: Use OpenAI's chat completions endpoint to generate trading strategies based on the extracted parameters and stock data.
4. **Validate and Enhance Strategy Data**:
    - For each strategy, validate the expiration dates.
    - If dates are valid, fetch option prices and strike prices from the Polygon API.
    - Replace AI-generated prices with real-time data where available.
5. **Format and Send Response**: Format the final strategies and send the response to the client.

#### Error Handling:
- **Invalid Parameters**: Ensure all required fields are present and valid.
- **API Errors**: Handle errors from the OpenAI or Polygon API gracefully, falling back to AI-generated data if necessary.
- **Internal Errors**: Return a generic error message if an unexpected error occurs during processing.

#### Dependencies:
- `openai`: For interacting with the OpenAI API.
- `axios`: For making HTTP requests to the Polygon API.
- `date-and-time`: For handling date formatting and manipulation.
- `picocolors`: For colored console output during debugging.
- `getStocks`: Custom utility for fetching stock data.
- `formatResponse`: Custom utility for formatting the API response.
